Automation
============

.. note::

    This is new feature which will be part of 1.4.0 release (available in August 2020). 

With Automation feature you can do 3 things:

1. automatically moving (cut/paste) of documents into their destination folder
2. automatically extract metadata from the document
3. and please forgive me for repetition - automatically extract pages

The whole idea is to remove boring and repetitive tasks.

Each automate instance consists of two very important parts:
    
* matching - what documents it applies to?
* action - what shall it do with matched document? 

Matching
~~~~~~~~~

In order to decide if automate instance applies to current document - it will look for certain
keywords in the document. For example if document contains capital case AWO and number 2020, then this document
must be routed to folder AWO/2020; if document contains word Linode and year 2020, then it will be routed to
Invoices/CloudExpenses/2020.

.. caution::
  
   It is crucial to understand that **matching is per Page**. Thus, statement *match a document* is not entirely correct. 
   Automation processes is triggered every time when :ref:`OCR <ocr>` for
   certain page completes. :ref:`OCRed <ocrs>` page is sent to automation module and
   Papermerge will try to match each automate instance on it. In case there is
   a match - it is considered that document matched automate criteria,
   although technically correct is - page of respective the document matched!

There are 4 different ways to match:

1. Any
2. All
3. Literal
4. Regular Expression

With ``Any`` matching algorithm, document matches **if any of mentioned keyword will match**.
With ``All``, document matches **if all mentioned keywords are found in document**. Keywords order does not matter.
With ``Literal``, match means that the text you enter must appear in the document exactly as you've entered it.
You can use ``Regular Expression`` for matching criteria. Regular expressions is a general programming method of text matching. Computer programmers usually know what it means.
